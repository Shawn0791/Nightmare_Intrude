## Game Overview

This is a text adventure game inspired by "Kayla is famous".

Players will need to collect pieces of lost emotions and discover their lost memories as they play.  

Personally, I love the story of this game, but due to time constraints I wasn't able to get into it. I also used translation software to translate the text, which may have caused a lot of problems, so I apologise for that.



## Job Responsibilities

Independent development

## Design Concept

The game draws its primary inspiration from the "Assassin's Creed" series and incorporates parkour assassinations from "Katana ZERO."

## Game Mechanics

Damage inflicted in direct combat between the player and enemies is very limited, but stunning enemies from behind is possible. Players can use the "Execution" skill to deal massive damage to stunned enemies. Some thrown projectiles and time manipulation abilities make it easier for players to navigate challenging terrain.

## Game Highlights

Enemies' heads can be used as projectiles to stun other enemies, and executed enemies will drop body fragments, enabling a continuous cycle of assassinations. Players can rely on this ability to achieve parkour-style progress.

## Game Controls

Character movement: AD

Character jump: Space

Enter the portal: W

Character pick up: C

Character skills: Q & E

There are in-game instructions available.
